 
SaganSimulator is a gravitational simulator created in C language as a final project for my Undergraduate Program in Information Systems. We choose this name as a tribute to one of the greatest promoters of science, Dr. Carl Sagan.

The code is being developed in ANSI C language. For now, it is possible to compile it under both operational systems, linux and windows. We are using the Code Blocks IDE to agile the development time.

The code still under development and may contain some issues. Right now we are working to finish to implementation of the energy control routine. Also, a OpenCL code version is under development, to take advantage of the GPU parallel processing capabilities.

Project Advisors:

Prof. Dr. Luis Fernando Fortes Garcia - Faculdade Dom Bosco de Porto Alegre, Brazil
